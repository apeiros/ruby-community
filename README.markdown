### Setup

* Ruby version: >= 2.3.0
* System dependencies: PostgreSQL v. 9.4+
* Configuration:
  * `cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml`
  * `cp config/secrets.example.yml config/secrets.yml`
  * `cp config/application.example.yml config/application.yml`
* Database creation: `rake db:create db:schema:load`
* Database initialization: `rake db:seed`
* Some data resides in db/data. You can load it using `psql -f`. Take a look at db/data/README.markdown.
* How to run the test suite: no test suite so far.

If you also want to test the private section, you have to additionally do:

* add "127.0.0.1 ruby-community" to your /etc/hosts (it can be on the same line as "127.0.0.1 localhost", e.g. "127.0.0.1 localhost ruby-community").
* go to your github profile > applications, there click the "Developer applications" tab, then hit the "Register new application" button.
* Fill out "Application Name", "Homepage URL", "Application Description" with whatever you want, they do not matter.
* Fill out "Authorization callback URL" with "http://ruby-community:3000/users/auth/github/callback".
* Update your config/secrets.yml with Client-ID (github\_app) and Client Secret (github\_secret) which github shows you.
* Restart your server and open it as "http://ruby-community:3000/" in your browser (NOT as "http://127.0.0.1:3000" or "http://localhost:3000/, the login will not work there").

Take also a look at the "Contribute" section below.
